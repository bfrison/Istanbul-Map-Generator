# Istanbul-Map-Generator
An app that generates a random map for the board game Istanbul by RÃ¼diger Dorn.
The app can be used for the original version of the game and for the Mocha & Baksheesh expansion.
It assigns randomly 16 tiles from 1 to 16 (20 for Mocha & Baksheesh) and enforces the rules from the rule book, i.e. the fountain must be in the center tiles, and the tea house and black markets at least 3 movement points away from each other.
The source code is written in Java and the GUI uses JavaFX.
